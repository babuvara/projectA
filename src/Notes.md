1. First JVM gets loaded  
  1. Main method gets executed  
  1. ApplicationContext is loaded  
  1. ApplicationContext reads xml configuration file     
  1. ApplicationContext pre-loads one object for each bean in the config file   
             if the bean is not marked as lazy-init= "true"  
  1. lazy-init="true" This informs springContainer not to pre-load object for this bean  
  1. By default Spring early loads objects in memory.  
  1. For lazy-init beans object is created only when the getBean() method is called.  
  1. For pre-init beans getBean() returns the reference of the pre-loaded object  
  1. By default only one object for every bean is created(singleton)  
  1. singleton: Atleast one object for every class but not more than one object  
  1. Spring for lazy-init beans creates a singleton object on firstcall of getBeans() method  
   and then uses that object for future getBean() method calls

## Prototype  
Prototype beans are by default lazy-init  
Prototypes are not singleton  
A new object is created for Prototype when getBean() method is called every time  
java  
    <bean id="act" class="com.chainsys.ProjectA.beans.Actor" scope="prototype"></bean>

## Bean with parameterize constructor  


```java
	<bean id="film" class="com.chainsys.ProjectA.beans.Movie"> 
		<constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="Arundhadhi" />
		<constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" value="Praveena" />
	</bean>
```

## Factory method  
```java
	 <bean id="nvsilunch" class="com.chainsys.ProjectA.beans.Lunch" factory-method="createNonvegSouthIndianLunch"
	factory-bean="lf"/>
	<bean id="vsilunch" class="com.chainsys.ProjectA.beans.Lunch" factory-method="createVegSouthIndianLunch"
	factory-bean="lf"/>
	<bean id="nilunch" class="com.chainsys.ProjectA.beans.Lunch" factory-method="createNorthIndianLunch"
	factory-bean="lf"/>
	<bean id="chlunch" class="com.chainsys.ProjectA.beans.Lunch" factory-method="createChineseIndianLunch"
	factory-bean="lf"/>
```
